## Project Review
This was the first project, aside from the tutorial project you can do with Github Desktop, that I published on my Github page.

It was meant to be a simple project that helped me familiarize myself with the layout of Github. The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple, in a 3 x 3 grid two people, one represented by an X and one by an O, would 
take turns leaving their respective mark in one space of the grid and the winner was decided by whoever could get three in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. These rules, easy enough for a human 
to understand, were much harder to implement through code than I anticipated.

It didn't take hours of grueling effort and googling, but the project did extend long enough for me to learn that even the projects that seemed easy in concept could be difficult to implement in practice. The game itself
is played in the console, or terminal, and so what I found most difficult about the project was creating a grid for players to play on that also would detect when a "three in a row" match was made. I had a general idea of 
how I could accomplish it, but if I were to go back and do this project again I believe I'd start by first creating a rough draft detailing the logic, step by step, that would go into creating the game rather than diving 
right into programming.
